Quest - Quest is a 1st person perspective view dungeon crawl.
   
\section play Running Quest
   
   The command "./quest" runs the game
   
   Control the location and direction of the team with the buttons 
   on the control pad in the control window or the arrow keys.
   
   To touch things, put the cursor on them and hit the left mouse button.
   
   Clicking on a object in the inventory makes it the item being used. 
   


VERSION  0.25
   

DESCRIPTION
   
   Quest provides examples of approaches to solving several problems in 
   3D programming.  Some of the problems it addresses are:
   
   
    * Providing some simple widgets in OpenGL
   
    * Reducing the system load by only redrawing when needed
   
    * Using .png files as textures
   
    * Selecting items in the scene with the mouse
   
    * Simple animation with OpenGL textures 
   
    * Using gluCylinder to draw from point to point
   

DEPENDENCIES
   
    * OpenGL ':all'
   
    * OpenGL::Image
      
    * Math::Trig
   
    * Image::Magick module; 6.3.5 or newer is recommended.

\section newstuff Generating New Scenarios for Quest
   
   Quest is a small game and a framework for adding scenarios to expand 
   the game.

   New quests/scenarios are added by adding maps that define the new area and 
   associated actions and tying those maps to rooms in the "Adventurer's Inn".
   Users are invited to create new maps and expand the game capabilities.
   
   Building map files is described in class Map and in page Map Items
   
   Add char and logic to start map to enter new scenario
   
   The command "./quest maps/new_quests.txt" will bring up the collections of
   scenes, props and characters already available for use in new quests.
   

\page hist History, Organization and Plans

Quest Game
Subject: Thoughts


The game Quest is based on several 1st person perspective games and some text adventure games.  The basic idea is that a small group wanders around inside a structure (cave, dungeon,castle,??) attempting to accomplish a series of minor goals leading to a more major goal. discovering what the goals are is part of the challenge of the game.

The game is drawn from Dungeon Master, Bards Tale, the Wizardry series, and others.

Scenario:

The lead finds themself in a building.  An enscription on a wall (over a door?) or  a person says "Welcome to the Adventures Inn.  Here you will find several folks that want your help with their quests and some folks that can help you."

Wandering around I saw a treasure chest behind a grate-like door.  The door would not open.  Most of the doors were wooden and locked, but in one room sat a small girl.  When I entered the room, she asked "Will you help me?  The gnomes have stolen my dog and hidden him in their caves.  If you help me, I'll teach you how to make a map of where you have been and what you have seen."

Foolishly, I accepted.  She lead me out a door I had not seen and (across the fields into a cave) or (suddenly we were in a cave).  As we wandered through the cave, the map she was writing (overhead) filled in with where we had been and where we had seen but not yet visited.

We came to a locked iron grate. "There must be a key around somewhere" she said.  We looked in every corner of the cave we could get to.  We found a chest that we could open with some treasures and gold in it..   We collected them.  In a back corner we found a switch on the wall.  When I moved it, I thought I heard a sound like a click.  We went back to try the door  again.  Without her map we might not have found it.

This time the door was open.  We were able to get into the other part of the cave.  Again we found a chest and "liberated" its contents.  After wandering some more, we found her dog tied to (a ring set into the wall).  We used a knife from one of the chests to cut the rope and headed out of the cave.

When we got back to the Inn, she (taught me the mapping skill)(magic map) (gave me the mapping kit).  She also gave me two keys.  One opened the grate door so I could save my treasure in that chest.  I opened the grate and the empty chest.  I put all the gold and treasure into the chest. (A voice said "you scored 20/50 on that quest).

The other key opened one of the wooden doors.  The person it that room  asked me to help the with their quest.



Tavern

Tavern is a device to allow multiple mini quests. Each room of the
tavern has a person in it.  Entering the room gets them to tell their
story.  Need way to choose to work with one.  Completing each quest might provide a new tool/ability.  Each person could take you to a different time period/landscape.

Pictures of Cher(My jeweled necklacewas stolen), Elvis, Batman,Knight, Merlin,Child(Please help me find my dog, Alex.  The jester stole him and hid him in the castle basement), teenage boy, ninja,barbarian, time traveler,robot,...






Issues:

Scoring and "winning" - We might use the trick from Collsal Cave and have a number of points achievable in each adventure.  The score would show as n/M.  Collecting gold and finding things would give points.

Games often take several hours(days) to complete.  Must be able to
save state of game and restore it to continue the game.


How to add failure or missteps?  Should have death?  Games that have no way to get in trouble are dull.  Colossal Cave had a turn limit to complete the game and get all the points.

How do we make floors and walls have more variety in appearance?  Can we fill a polygon with multiple instances of an image?

Would it make sense to have food and water important in the game?  You could by supplies before each trek and they would need to last until you got out of the cave.  Longer treks require more supplies, like a hiking trip.  It might offer a way to add challenge without fighting.
